"""The EmployeeDatabase keeps track of all the employees in the company. For each employee, it tracks the id, name,

used to create employees. 

It exposes an .employees property that returns the list of employees. The Employee objects are created in an internal method ._create_employee(). Notice that you donâ€™t have different types of Employee classes. You just need to implement a single Employee class:

"""The Employee class is initialized with the id, name, and address attributes. It also requires the productivity 
role for the employee and the payroll policy. 

The class exposes a .work() method that takes the hours worked. This method first retrieves the duties from the role. In other words, it delegates to the role object to perform its duties.

In the same way, it delegates to the payroll object to track the work hours. The payroll, as you saw, uses those hours to calculate the payroll if needed."""
